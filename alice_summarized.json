There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \u201cOh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!\u201d (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.

First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled \u201cORANGE MARMALADE\u201d, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.  \u201cWell!\u201d thought Alice to herself, \u201cafter such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they\u2019ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn\u2019t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!\u201d (Which was very likely true.)",

Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think\u2014\u201d (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) \u201c\u2014yes, that\u2019s about the right distance\u2014but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I\u2019ve got to?\u201d (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)  Presently she began again. \u201cI wonder if I shall fall right _through_ the earth! How funny it\u2019ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think\u2014\u201d (she was rather glad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn\u2019t sound at all the right word) \u201c\u2014but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma\u2019am, is this New Zealand or Australia?\u201d (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke\u2014fancy _curtseying_ as you\u2019re falling through the air!

But do cats eat bats, I wonder?\u201d And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, \u201cDo cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?\u201d and sometimes, \u201cDo bats eat cats?\u201d for, you see, as she couldn\u2019t answer either question, it didn\u2019t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, \u201cNow, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?\u201d when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.",

There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.

Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.\u201d For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.  There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (\u201cwhich certainly was not here before,\u201d said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words \u201cDRINK ME,\u201d beautifully printed on it in large letters.

I think that will be the best plan.\u201d  It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry.",

Alice comments on the watch, and the Hatter deflects the conversation, changing the subject to the Dormouse, who has fallen asleep and is poured hot tea on its nose.\n\nThe conversation becomes increasingly confusing, with the Hatter and March Hare admitting they don't know the answer to a riddle, and Alice expressing frustration. The Hatter reveals that Time is a person, implying that Alice has never met him. Alice learns that beating time is futile and that the Hatter suggests manipulating Time to adjust the clock.\n\nThe Queen interrupts the Hatter's singing, demanding his head, and Alice is shocked by her savagery. The Hatter explains the March Hare's uncooperativeness and the perpetual state of tea time, which leads to clutter. Alice is asked to tell a story, and the Dormouse tells a tale about three sisters living at the bottom of a well, surviving on treacle.\n\nThe conversation becomes even more confusing, with the group learning to draw objects starting with the letter M and the Dormouse rambling about words starting with M. Alice's frustration escalates, causing her to storm off, but the others remain oblivious. She then spots a door in a tree and enters it, finding herself back in the long hall. She uses the little golden key to unlock the door to the garden, eats a growth-enhancing mushroom, and proceeds through the passage, ultimately arriving in a stunning garden filled with flowers and fountains."
